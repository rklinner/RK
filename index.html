    I began my career with Shocco Springs in May of 1992 as a 16-year-old kid.
    For the next few years, I continued part-time employment with Shocco while attending a local community college.
    While pursuing a Chemical Engineering degree at Auburn University, I had the opportunity to intern at a local paper mill.
    During the summer of 1997, in the stillness of the paper mill lab, God opened my eyes.
    I began to see how everything up to that point in my life revolved solely around myself and what I could achieve.
    God simply wasn’t in the plan. At that point in life, God began to show me what a Christ-centered life should look like.
    I left Auburn, and as they say, “the rest is history.”
